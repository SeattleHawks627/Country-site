            Sweden has very popular winters , and that is for many reasons. The snow is pleantiful <br>
            and the snow makes Sweden look even better. It may be very cold but the Natives have gotten used to it, and it becomes extremly enjoyable.
            The people there make the winter even better during Christmas because it is one of the Happiest Countrys.
